To run this application locally, browse to the parent directory of where the
ui.R and server.R scripts, open up R such that the `getwd()` is the
parent directory. Then load shiny, by using `library(shiny)` and then
launch the application by typing `runApp("shiny-country-timeseries")`

The app requires the following R packages to be installed: RCurl,
ggplot2, stringr, reshape2, magrittr, dplyr, scales, shiny

The app can also be viewed online by visiting:
https://chendaniely.shinyapps.io/shinyCountryTimeseries/

Except it's not working right now and I don't know why.

In the meantime, you can run the app by using my dropbox link

    library(shiny)
	runUrl("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/356714/shinyCountryTimeseries.zip")



TODO
====
I have a few ideas on how to build out the plot further:

* Overlay R0 curves over the cases plots
  * Give sliders to adjust initial number of cases and R0

* Overlay other pandemic curves in cases/deaths for comparison

Additional suggestions and datasets welcome!
