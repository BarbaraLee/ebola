To run this application, browse to the parent directory of where the
ui.R and server.R scripts, open up R such that the `getwd()` is the
parent directory. Then load shiny, by using `library(shiny)` and then
launch the application by typing `runApp("shiny-country-timeseries")`

The app requires the following R packages to be installed: RCurl,
ggplot2, stringr, reshape2, dplyr, scales, shiny

The app can also be viewed online by visiting:

Except it's not working right now and I don't know why.
